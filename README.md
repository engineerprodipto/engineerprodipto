python trick for reversing a string.............
strvarname[::-1]
print('this a string {}'.format('INSERTED'))................this inserts the string inside the format in place of the curly braces in the original string
print('the {q} {b} fox jumped over the {l} dog'.format(q='quick',l='lazy',b='brown'))
float formatting- {value:width(# actually white spaces).precisionf}
eg: res=1000/777
print("the result is {r:1.2f}".format(r=res))
the result is 1.29
name='proxlr8'
print(f'his name is {name}') OR print('his name is {}'.format(name))
output: 
his name is proxlr8
